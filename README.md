# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hello! I'm a first-year student at Keio University SFC's Faculty of Environment and Information Studies. I enjoy creating games with **Unity** and **Blender**, and I'm currently developing a generalist robot that integrates multiple modalities and a physical body using **Python** and **C#**. I'm also part of the **Sociable Robotics Lab** at Keio SFC.
